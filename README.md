in this project, we will delve into the dynamics of multi-threading, where threads concurrently execute, introducing challenges like race conditions and data races. We will explore the intricacies of thread creation and synchronization, addressing these challenges through the implementation of mutexes and semaphores. Throughout this exploration of threads and synchronization mechanisms, we will develop the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of multi-threaded environments
